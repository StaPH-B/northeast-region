      <h2 id="welcome-to-northeast-region-bioinformatics-regional-resource-site">Welcome to Northeast Region Bioinformatics Regional Resource Site</h2>

<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> OAMD seeks to develop an effective public health workforce prepared to address infectious disease threats, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improved workforce knowledge and skills regarding next-generation sequencing (NGS),
bioinformatics, and other AMD technologies.</li>
  <li>Improved NGS capacity in state and local health departments.</li>
</ul>

<p>With regards to building bioinformatics capacity at the state a local public health level, this will be achieved through the following activities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Assist the regional training lead in developing and carrying out training. This may involve, for example, assisting in the development of web-based modules that could be used within the region or nationally.</li>
  <li>Consult with states and localities in the region on bioinformatics problems. This may involve, for example, performing ad hoc bioinformatics analysis for those states or localities or assisting a staff member in one of their laboratories in doing his or her own analysis.</li>
  <li>Coordinate and communicate with regional training leads and participants for
bioinformatics technical support</li>
  <li>Consult with local or state IT departments regarding IT policies necessary to support AMD implementation.</li>
  <li>Work with states or localities to resolve IT problems that are limiting the use of AMD technologies.</li>
  <li>Assist states and large localities in the region in bioinformatics analysis, either by assisting staff in those organizations or by performing the analysis themselves.</li>
  <li>Work with state labs and CDC to find sustainable, affordable solutions to state and local health department AMD-related informatics needs such as storage and cloud computing.</li>
  <li>Work with state and local health departments to promote data sharing (where needed and appropriate).</li>
</ul>
