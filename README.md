## Welcome to Northeast Region Bioinformatics Regional Resource Site

**Purpose:** The CDC's Office of Advanced Molecular Detection (OAMD) seeks to develop an effective public health workforce prepared to address infectious disease threats, including:

- Improved workforce knowledge and skills regarding next-generation sequencing (NGS),
bioinformatics, and other AMD technologies.
- Improved NGS capacity in state and local health departments.

With regards to building bioinformatics capacity at the state a local public health level, this will be achieved through the following activities:
- Assist the regional training lead in developing and carrying out training. This may involve, for example, assisting in the development of web-based modules that could be used within the region or nationally.
- Consult with states and localities in the region on bioinformatics problems. This may involve, for example, performing ad hoc bioinformatics analysis for those states or localities or assisting a staff member in one of their laboratories in doing his or her own analysis.
- Coordinate and communicate with regional training leads and participants for
bioinformatics technical support.
- Consult with local or state IT departments regarding IT policies necessary to support AMD implementation.
- Work with states or localities to resolve IT problems that are limiting the use of AMD technologies.
- Assist states and large localities in the region in bioinformatics analysis, either by assisting staff in those organizations or by performing the analysis themselves.
- Work with state labs and CDC to find sustainable, affordable solutions to state and local health department AMD-related informatics needs such as storage and cloud computing.
- Work with state and local health departments to promote data sharing (where needed and appropriate).

With regards to our workforce development at the state a local public health level, this will be achieved through the following activities:

- Hosting new and existing trainings, collaborating with local or regional partners where
possible.
- Conducting training needs assessment before scheduling regional or local training.
- Conducting training evaluations to measure impact of course(s) and perform continuous
improvement of training program.
- Coordinating training activities with regional training participants.

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health is funded as both the Workforce Development Lead and Bioinformatics Regional Resource for the Northeast Region.  **Any lab within the Northeast Region needing assistance with any activity described above should feel free to contact Glen Gallagher or Joel Sevinsky at the MA Department of Health.**  We are funded through the ELC grant for these activities and there is no cost associated with this assistance.
